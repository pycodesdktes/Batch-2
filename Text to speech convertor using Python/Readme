Project Description

Text to speech is a process to convert any text into voice. Text to speech
project takes words on digital devices and convert them into audio with a button
click or finger touch. Text to speech python project is very helpful for people who
are struggling with reading.
We have successfully developed the text to speech python project. We
used the popular tkinter library for rendering graphics on a display window,
pyttsx3 library to convert text to voice, and play that converter voice from the text.
